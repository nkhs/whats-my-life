    "title": "INFP: The Healer",
    "subTitle": "(Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Perceiving)",
    "description": "INFP is an acronym used to describe one of the sixteen personality types created by Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers. It stands for Introverted, iNtuitive, Feeling, Perceiving. INFP indicates a person who is energized by time alone (Introverted), who focuses on ideas and concepts rather than facts and details (iNtuitive), who makes decisions based on feelings and values (Feeling) and who prefers to be spontaneous and flexible rather than planned and organized (Perceiving). INFPs are sometimes referred to as Healer personalities due to their sympathetic idealism and gentle compassion for other people.",
    "image": "INFP.png",
    "strengths": "Idealism\nIntegrity\nCompromise\nDedication",
    "weaknesses": "Sensitivity\nImpracticality\nSelflessness\nVulunerability",
    "overview": "INFPs are imaginative idealists, guided by their own core values and beliefs. To a Healer, possibilities are paramount; the realism of the moment is only of passing concern. They see potential for a better future, and pursue truth and meaning with their own individual flair.\n\nINFPs are sensitive, caring, and compassionate, and are deeply concerned with the personal growth of themselves and others. Individualistic and nonjudgmental, INFPs believe that each person must find their own path. They enjoy spending time exploring their own ideas and values, and are gently encouraging to others to do the same. INFPs are creative and often artistic; they enjoy finding new outlets for self-expression.",
    "mentalAgeTitle": "INFP – 60",
    "mentalAgeDescription": "No matter what your biological age is, you were born as and remain an old soul. You have been questioning the greater truths about life for as long as you can remember, but your wisdom is supported by an inherently youthful sense of curiosity that drives you to explore each issue from multiple different angles. You may best be best described as 60 going on 6 – you have the sagacity of someone much older than yourself but the insatiable curiosity of someone much younger.",
    "animalTitle": "INFP – The Asian Elephant",
    "animalDescription": "Compassionate, wise, and even sentimental, we couldn’t imagine a better fit for the INFP personality type. These gentle giants are one of the only animals that show a great capacity for empathy. Researchers have watched female elephants help baby elephants climb up muddy banks or out of holes. They’ve seen elephants assisting others that are injured, pulling out tranquilizer darts, or even spraying dust on each other’s wounds. These empathic animals even mourn their dead and comfort other elephants that are mourning. On top of this, elephants are creative – they work together to solve puzzles and can even paint portraits!",
    "officeTitle": "INFP: Pam Beesly",
    "officeDescription": "As an INFP personality, Pam may seem reserved on the outside, but on the inside she's bubbling with passion for the things she loves, like art. In the beginning of the series, Pam's mode of handling conflict was totally INFP behavior — avoiding confrontation at all costs and trying to remain diplomatic at all times — but then, we got to see her come out of her shell more and stand up for herself, and it was a beautiful thing. Like other INFPs, Pam also looks at love and relationships in an idealistic way, and she definitely got exactly the fairytale that she wanted in Jim.",
    "pizzaTitle": "Vegan Pizza",
    "pizzaDescription": "You are pure of heart and highly guided by your principles. You need a pizza that’s just as good for the environment as it is good-tasting. As one of the most compassionate and altruistic personality types, you’d be heartbroken if any animals were harmed in the making of this product. We’re talking cruelty-free, non-GMO, dairy-free, gluten-free… you know what, why not just make the whole pizza free? Wouldn’t that be nice?",
    "coffeeTitle": "Iced Latte",
    "coffeeDescription": "The same dependability with less of the intensity. You both know how to let your hair down. You are creative and idealistic. You have a close circle of friends you live and die for. And while you have no problems being who you are, you prefer to internalize and search life for all its possibilities.",
    "travelTitle": "Venice, Italy",
    "travelDescription": "Venice feels like a city removed from the rest of the world, still grand and beautiful despite looking a little worn these days.\n\nThere are awe-inspiring monuments such as the San Marco’s Basilica and Teatro la Fenice, a labyrinthe of winding alleys that reveal one-of-a-kind stores, as well as the city-wide masquerade festival (Carnevale di Venezia) that will make you feel like you’ve indeed entered another world. This is definitely a place for dreamers and romantics.\n\nThe imaginative INFP will be drawn to this stunning city that inspires the imagination and evokes fresh ideas."

    "type": "INFJ",
    "title": "INFJ: The Counselor",
    "subTitle": "(Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Judging)",
    "description": "INFJ is one of the sixteen personality types created by Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers. INFJ is an acronym for the personality traits of Introversion, iNtuition, Feeling, and Judging. The INFJ type is also called the \"Counselor\" and is described as idealistic, compassionate, and sensitive.\n\nEach of the four letters of the INFJ code signifies a key personality trait of this type. INFJs are energized by time alone (Introverted), focus on ideas and concepts rather than facts and details (iNtuitive), make decisions based on feelings and values (Feeling) and prefer to be planned and organized rather than spontaneous and flexible (Judging).",
    "image": "INFJ.png",
    "strengths": "Practical insight\nCompassion\nKeeping the peace\nDecisiveness",
    "weaknesses": "Overlooking details\nIntensely private\nConflict averse\nSensitive",
    "overview": "INFJs are creative nurturers with a strong sense of personal integrity and a drive to help others realize their potential. Creative and dedicated, they have a talent for helping others with original solutions to their personal challenges.\n\nThe Counselor has a unique ability to intuit others' emotions and motivations, and will often know how someone else is feeling before that person knows it himself. They trust their insights about others and have strong faith in their ability to read people. Although they are sensitive, they are also reserved; the INFJ is a private sort, and is selective about sharing intimate thoughts and feelings.",
    "mentalAgeTitle": "INFJ - 90",
    "mentalAgeDescription": "Chances are, some part of you has always felt older than those around you. You dwell eternally in the deep end of life – questioning its nature and meaning in depth, while remaining endlessly patient with those around you. You have the empathy and insight of someone much older than yourself – you are a natural sage, regardless of your biological age.",
    "animalTitle": "INFJ – The Humpback Whale",
    "animalDescription": "Empathetic, protective, and even introverted – these gentle giants are the closest animal we could find to embodying the INFJ personality type. Unusually protective of even those outside their species, they will deliberately interfere with attacking killer whales to help others in distress – helping animals like gray whale calves, seals, and other sea creatures. Peace-loving and known for their complex songs, these animals capture the compassionate, insightful nature of the INFJ.",
    "officeTitle": "INFJ: Angela Martin",
    "officeDescription": "INFJs are rare, but then again, isn't Angela? They hold integrity as a core personal value, which relates to how Angela loves to play by the rules and do everything by the book. They're hard to get close to and they can get pretty intense when it comes to their beliefs being put into question, but much like Angela, an INFJ can make a deep connection with anyone they choose to get close to (like Dwight).",
    "pizzaTitle": "Supreme “Everything” Pizza",
    "pizzaDescription": "Its got sausage, its got pepperoni, its got veggies, its got everything you could want on a pizza, plus some olives thrown in too. There’s something on this pizza for everyone, and everyone is exactly who an INFJ wants to please. Why fight over pizza toppings when you could just have ALL THE TOPPINGS!!! Ultimately, you’d be a pizza that cares less about what’s on it, and more about what the person who’s eating it wants to be on it. As long as everyone’s happy, you’re happy.",
    "coffeeTitle": "Turkish Coffee",
    "coffeeDescription": "You are a traditionalist. You like things done with feeling, with a history behind it. And no coffee holds more history than this one. An effortless pairing of ground coffee and sugar water, this drink has been the favorite of Sultans and Kings. Its legacy is strong, much like your sense of self. You enjoy the details of life, finding pleasure in a sunset or the solitude of a long walk.",
    "travelTitle": "Copenhagen, Denmark",
    "travelDescription": "INFJs don’t always require a jam-packed itinerary for a fulfilling journey. They are content to take their time to explore and wander around the streets, putting their intuition and decision-making skills to good use. They are also more free-wheeling than INTJs (more on them below), and prefer less meticulous planning before and when they travel.\n\nCopenhagen is a great fit for the INFJ. Aside from the measured pace of life there, its clean and efficient public transport system and orderliness makes it easy to get around. Copenhagen’s abundance of cafes is also ideal for the INFJ to spend pensive afternoons chilling with a book or people-watching over a cup of coffee."

    "subTitle": "(Extroverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Judging)",
    "description": "ENFJ is an acronym used to describe one of the sixteen personality types created by Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers. It stands for Extraverted, iNtuitive, Feeling, Judging. ENFJ indicates a person who is energized by time spent with others (Extraverted), who focuses on ideas and concepts rather than facts and details (iNtuitive), who makes decisions based on feelings and values (Feeling) and who prefers to be planned and organized rather than spontaneous and flexible (Judging). ENFJs are sometimes referred to as Teacher personalities because of their interest in helping others develop and grow.",
    "image": "ENFJ.png",
    "strengths": "Peacekeeping\nCommunication\nPersuasiveness\nLeadership",
    "weaknesses": "Leap before looking\nOvercommitment\nStruggle to make tough decisions\nToo selfless",
    "overview": "ENFJs are idealist organizers, driven to implement their vision of what is best for humanity. They often act as catalysts for human growth because of their ability to see potential in other people and their charisma in persuading others to their ideas. They are focused on values and vision, and are passionate about the possibilities for people.\n\nENFJs are typically energetic and driven, and often have a lot on their plates. They are tuned into the needs of others and acutely aware of human suffering; however, they also tend to be optimistic and forward-thinking, intuitively seeing opportunity for improvement. The ENFJ is ambitious, but their ambition is not self-serving: rather, they feel personally responsible for making the world a better place.",
    "mentalAgeTitle": "ENFJ - 40",
    "mentalAgeDescription": "You’ve always naturally assumed the role of the wise mentor to those in your life. Your mental prowess resembles that of someone who is old enough to make decisions rationally and compassionately, yet young enough to execute them with an idealistic sense of enthusiasm. Your “Mother Hen” role in others’ lives plants you at the beginning of middle-age, mentally. You have a youthful energy backed up by an indisputable well of wisdom.",
    "animalTitle": "ENFJ – The Arabian Horse",
    "animalDescription": "Gentle, intelligent, and persistent – Arabian horses capture many of the strengths of the ENFJ personality type. These dazzling horses are known for their responsiveness to humans. In fact, they’re one of the best horses for families and children and can often recognize and respond to human emotions. They are also known for their passionate spirit – their endurance is considered higher than any other racing horse. When they have a goal there’s nearly nothing that can stop them – much like the ENFJ.",
    "officeTitle": "ENFJ: Kelly Kapoor",
    "officeDescription": "Like a typical ENFJ, Kelly is filled with passion and is a very social person. She's usually in a good mood and ready to have a great time, even at work. It's said that people who have ENFJ personalities jump immediately into a big commitment in their romantic relationships, and... well, we've seen exactly that happen with Ryan, even though he didn't feel the same way for most of their relationship.",
    "pizzaTitle": "Cheese Pizza",
    "pizzaDescription": "Everyone, and we mean EVERYONE loves you — just like everyone loves cheese pizza. In fact, we aren’t sure what’s warmer and gooier: melted cheese or an ENFJ? Super charismatic and impossible to resist, an ENFJ is popular amongst almost everyone for exactly who they are — a classic crowd-pleaser and trail-blazer.",
    "coffeeTitle": "Irish Coffee",
    "coffeeDescription": "A shot of whiskey and whipped cream makes even the most mundane of parties fun! You are outgoing, pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable. Charismatic to a fault, no one can resist your charms. And while you value friendships and laughs, take care to appraise the appropriate situations for your unique brand of humor.",
    "travelTitle": "Melbourne, Australia",
    "travelDescription": "ENFJs love and crave human interaction. They seek places that can satisfy their outgoing personality, where people are as warm and chatty and laidback as they are. Melbourne is one such place; everyone is a friend there. The locals are friendly and baristas are always up for small talk.\n\nWhile it’s also a city, Melbourne does not go at a frenetic pace. It has plenty of homegrown businesses, particularly in the suburbs, where the ENFJ can make new friends while café-hopping."

    "overview": "ENFPs are people-centered creators with a focus on possibilities and a contagious enthusiasm for new ideas, people and activities. Energetic, warm, and passionate, ENFPs love to help other people explore their creative potential.\n\nENFPs are typically agile and expressive communicators, using their wit, humor, and mastery of language to create engaging stories.

    "mentalAgeTitle": "ENFP - 21",
    "mentalAgeDescription": "No matter how old you become, you maintain the drive, enthusiasm and passion of someone who is just coming into his or her own. You are young at heart but old in spirit – you may best be described as 21 going on 90. You have the energy of someone much younger than yourself but the wisdom of someone much older.",
    "animalTitle": "ENFP – The Dolphin",
    "animalDescription": "Smart, friendly, and curious – dolphins capture many of the personality traits we love about ENFPs. These marine mammals are very creative and inventive, finding unique ways to capture fish and survive. For example, they sometimes wear sponges on their noses to protect themselves near rocks. They’re also capable of playing, tumbling, leaping, and socializing for enjoyment and fun. Like ENFPs, their creativity knows no bounds!",
    "officeTitle": "ENFP: Erin Hannon",
    "officeDescription": "People who have ENFP personalities tend to care a lot about others, and have outgoing personalities. However, they also tend to have their heads in the clouds, just like Erin usually does, so you have to understand that sometimes, they're going to throw away a disposable camera after taking a photo with it. But that's also part of Erin's charm, and just like many ENFPs, she's always fun, and she's always a ray of sunshine.",
    "pizzaTitle": "Buffalo Chicken Pizza",
    "pizzaDescription": "When we think of fun, we think ENFP. In fact, we are pretty sure the “F” actually stands for fun. You are free-spirited and feisty, just like a zippy hot buffalo sauce. Nothing goes together better than buffalo chicken wings and pizza, so what could be better than buffalo chicken pizza? It’s unique and full of flavor, just like you are!",
    "coffeeTitle": "Affogato",
    "coffeeDescription": "You are quite the eccentric. Ice cream?! In an espresso?! You are playful, enthusiastic—never one to turn down a dare. However, you are intensely supportive of your friends and know what they need and when to give them that push in the right direction.",
    "travelTitle": "Boracay, the Philippines",
    "travelDescription": "Life’s a party to an ENFP, and everyone is invited to it. With an inherent zest for life, the ENFP is always looking out for new adventures, and often seeks stimulation from activities involving lots of people.\n\nA place like Boracay would be a paradise for the free-spirited ENFP, as there are plenty of adrenaline-pumping activities for thrillseekers, including parasailing, cliff-diving and surfing."

INTJ indicates a person who is energized by time alone (Introverted), who focuses on ideas and concepts rather than facts and details (iNtuitive), who makes decisions based on logic and reason (Thinking) and who prefers to be planned and organized rather than spontaneous and flexible (Judging). INTJs are sometimes referred to as Mastermind personalities because of their strategic, logical way of thinking.",
    "image": "INTJ.png",
    "strengths": "Strategy\nInnovation\nDetermination\nWillingness to learn",
    "weaknesses": "Superiority\nEmotional distance\nPerfectionism\nImbalance",
    "overview": "INTJs are analytical problem-solvers, eager to improve systems and processes with their innovative ideas. They have a talent for seeing possibilities for improvement, whether at work, at home, or in themselves.\n\nOften intellectual, INTJs enjoy logical reasoning and complex problem-solving. They approach life by analyzing the theory behind what they see, and are typically focused inward, on their own thoughtful study of the world around them. INTJs are drawn to logical systems and are much less comfortable with the unpredictable nature of other people and their emotions. They are typically independent and selective about their relationships, preferring to associate with people who they find intellectually stimulating.",
    "mentalAgeTitle": "INTJ - 80",
    "mentalAgeDescription": "INTJs seem to mentally age at twice the rate of most other types. Their lifelong quest for knowledge means they advance intellectually in leaps and bounds – they have little patience for the constraints of youth and tend to befriend adults from the time they are young. This type has the wisdom of an old soul and the unconquerable thirst for knowledge that keeps them growing and expanding well beyond their years.",
    "animalTitle": "INTJ – The Octopus",
    "animalDescription": "Creative, clever, and strategic, the octopus captures the outside-the-box intelligence of the INTJ. These invertebrates are powerful hunters, strategically creating ways to outsmart predators. They can navigate their way through mazes, solve problems quickly, and even play – which is a clear sign of animal intelligence. They think quickly, using their pincers to grasp food and tear it apart or ejecting an inky cloud of darkness to evade predators.",
    "officeTitle": "INTJ: Darryl Philbin",
    "officeDescription": "Those who identify as INTJ are known as \"the architect,\" and since the 16 Personalities site describes them as \"ambitious but private,\" this description definitely fits Darryl perfectly. For seasons, he talked about his \"big plans\" for Dunder Mifflin before leaving to join Athlead with Jim. He was never ready to settle and always wanted to keep moving in his career — and managed to work his way up from the warehouse. If you're anything like Darryl, chances are you are also hard working with a good imagination, and you're probably also good at more than one thing, just like he easily adapted from the warehouse to working upstairs in the office.",
    "pizzaTitle": "Build Your Own Pizza",
    "pizzaDescription": "Known as the “architect,” you always have a vision for exactly what you want and know exactly how to execute it. In fact, you’ve probably tested which flavor combinations and which ratio of ingredients is best suited for your refined palate. Prosciutto, goat cheese, and fig marmalade on a thin Neapolitan crust? Yes, please! Only the best ingredients will do, preferably seasonal and artisan, and absolutely no sharing. You want a perfectly crafted personal pizza to enjoy in peace and quiet.",
    "coffeeTitle": "Cappuccino",
    "coffeeDescription": "With three parts existing harmoniously and autonomously: foam, milk and espresso, it’s the perfect paradox. Masters of independence, seekers of knowledge and logical dream-chasers, you want to be everything at once. Nothing settles your sanity better than a cappuccino: elegant, emphatic and partial to random epiphanies.",
    "travelTitle": "Morocco",
    "travelDescription": "Known for being highly analytical and meticulous, INTJs seek to learn and understand everything they can about a place they visit – even prior to the trip. They have a deep thirst for knowledge and often enjoy solo trips to history- or culture-rich destinations. They have no interest in guided tours or visiting tourist traps, preferring to forge their own paths instead.\n\nMorocco is home to several UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the medina of Marrakesh, and archaeological site of Volubilis. Aside from exploring these famous ancient sites, INTJs might enjoy trekking through the Torda Gorge, paying a visit to the Hassan Il Mosque, or going shutter-happy at the blue streets of Chefchaouen."

They are quick to see inefficiency and conceptualize new solutions, and enjoy developing long-range plans to accomplish their vision. They excel at logical reasoning and are usually articulate and quick-witted.\n\nENTJs are analytical and objective, and like bringing order to the world around them. When there are flaws in a system, the ENTJ sees them, and enjoys the process of discovering and implementing a better way. ENTJs are assertive and enjoy taking charge; they see their role as that of leader and manager, organizing people and processes to achieve their goals.",
    "mentalAgeTitle": "ENTJ - 55",
    "mentalAgeDescription": "The age of the average Fortune 500 CEO is 55 so it seemed only natural that this age would suit you best. For the majority of your life you’ve possessed the confidence, diligence and decisiveness of someone much older than yourself – and by middle age your body will finally catch up with the maturity of your mind. 55 may just be your time to shine… but who are we kidding. Your whole life is your time to shine.",
    "animalTitle": "ENTJ – The Cheetah",
    "animalDescription": "Self-sufficient, determined, and insightful about their prey – cheetahs capture the restless, ambitious spirit of the ENTJ. Known to be hard-working and somewhat impatient, ENTJs would appreciate that cheetahs are the fastest land animals in the world – sometimes reaching 112km/h in just three seconds! Like ENTJs, cheetahs also value autonomy, freedom, and a prepared responsiveness to life.",
    "officeTitle": "ENTJ: Michael Scott",
    "officeDescription": "ENTJs are extroverted, natural leaders, and that definitely applies to Michael (even if his employees might not think that he truly belongs in a leadership role). He sets big goals — like finding a cure for rabies or outpacing China as the world's super power — and goes for them full throttle, even if he has no idea how to truly achieve them. ENTJs also aren't always the most in tune with other people's feelings, which would certainly explain a lot of Michael behavior in his love life before he married Holly.",
    "pizzaTitle": "New York-Style Pizza",
    "pizzaDescription": "You’re the boss, ENTJ, and that’s that. Let there be no confusion about which pizza reigns supreme — it’s N.Y.C. by the slice. You’re someone who knows how to take charge and doesn’t put up with any nonsense. Likewise, N.Y.C. pizza is thin, sharp, and to the point with its crispy thin crust and generous portion size. No need to fuss with crazy toppings or stuffed crust. Just hand over the best slice in town and keep it movin’, pal.",
    "coffeeTitle": "Espresso",
    "coffeeDescription": "You are always “GO! GO! GO!” You live a hectic, fast-paced life of deadlines, meetings and appointments. Your schedule is packed, but is planned as if it were a work of art. And it is. You’re dedicated, ambitious and compartmentalizing. Maybe that’s the way you justify your Espresso Doppio (double shot!) twice a day.",
    "travelTitle": "Mauritius",
    "travelDescription": "ENTJs are go-getters to whom nothing is impossible. They love places that offer two different types of holidays — a laidback one in a luxury villa with a scenic view, and an exciting one filled with lots of activities.\n\nIsland life definitely suits the ENTJ. Mauritius features plenty of outdoorsy activities (snorkelling with dolphins, deep-diving in the ocean, skydiving, and more) and, of course, spectacular views that make for Insta-worthy snapshots."

They are curious and clever, and seek to comprehend the people, systems, and principles that surround them. Open-minded and unconventional, Visionaries want to analyze, understand, and influence other people.\n\nENTPs enjoy playing with ideas and especially like to banter with others. They use their quick wit and command of language to keep the upper hand with other people, often cheerfully poking fun at their habits and eccentricities. While the ENTP enjoys challenging others, in the end they are usually happy to live and let live. They are rarely judgmental, but they may have little patience for people who can't keep up.",

    "animalTitle": "ENTP – The Chimpanzee",
    "animalDescription": "Intelligent, innovative, and adventurous – chimpanzees embody many of the strengths of the ENTP personality type. They creatively build, invent games, enjoy playing, and have complex social relationships. Their innovative nature gives them the capacity to create their own spears to hunt for prey or even use long branches to dig for termites. This ability to adapt to their environment, be resourceful, and communicate with others in their troop reminds us of the sociability and imaginative intelligence of the ENTP.",
    "officeTitle": "ENTP: Jan Levinson",
    "officeDescription": "It goes without saying that Jan has one of the biggest personalities on the show, so she'd definitely be an ENTP. The fact that she doesn't hold back during arguments and likes to put everything out there is very typical of her personality type. She's ambitious and easily engages people, but on the downside, she also loves a good fight... and sometimes, someone's tiny plasma TV will get caught in the crossfire.",
    "pizzaTitle": "Pizza Dipped in Ranch",
    "pizzaDescription": "Ever the devil’s advocate, ENTPs will ask the hard-hitting questions of life. Like, does pizza and ranch sauce go together? Well, why not! In your world, every risk is a new adventure to embrace and every new flavor combo is worth exploring if only for the fun of it. Ranch not your thing? That’s cool, too. With an ENTP’s uncanny ability to see all sides of the situation, you’re rarely one to get flustered arguing over pizza. There are much greater issues you’ll gladly debate.",
    "coffeeTitle": "Flat White",
    "coffeeDescription": "A flat white is part espresso and part milky foam, creating the best of both worlds. Just like your coffee, you thrive on duality: enthusiastic but realistic, inquisitive but responsible. You know how to maintain a balance in life and you want a coffee that can achieve the same. The jolt from the espresso is juxtaposed heavenly by the rich and velvety milk. It’s your siren song.",
    "travelTitle": "Buenos Aires, Argentina",
    "travelDescription": "Quick-thinking ENTPs dread mundanity and routine. They like to be energised by their environment, and the city needs to be fast-paced enough to match their speed.\n\nThey enjoy being busy, packing as many activities in their itinerary as possible, and are stimulated by meeting new people, discovering new places and things, going on adventures and catching spectacular views. The perfect vacation spot for them is therefore Buenos Aires, where the people are friendly, the food is piquant and the nightlife is exciting."

    "subTitle": "(Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Perceiving)",
    "description": "INTP is an acronym used to describe one of the sixteen personality types created by Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers. It stands for Introverted, iNtuitive, Thinking, Perceiving. INTP indicates a person who is energized by time alone (Introverted), who focuses on ideas and concepts rather than facts and details (iNtuitive), who makes decisions based on logic and reason (Thinking) and who prefers to be spontaneous and flexible rather than planned and organized (Perceiving). INTPs are sometimes referred to as Architect personalities because of their intuitive understanding of complex systems.",
    "image": "INTP.png",
    "strengths": "Analytically brilliance\nObjective\nImaginative\nEnthusiastic",
    "weaknesses": "Uncertainty\nAbsent-mindedness\nCondescension\nInsensitivity",
    "overview": "INTPs are philosophical innovators, fascinated by logical analysis, systems, and design. They are preoccupied with theory, and search for the universal law behind everything they see. They want to understand the unifying themes of life, in all their complexity.\n\nINTPs are detached, analytical observers who can seem oblivious to the world around them because they are so deeply absorbed in thought. They spend much of their time focused internally: exploring concepts, making connections, and seeking understanding. To the Architect, life is an ongoing inquiry into the mysteries of the universe.",
    "mentalAgeTitle": "INTP - 45",
    "mentalAgeDescription": "Of all the types, INTPs may be the most difficult to fit into a particular mental age. This type has the intellectual capacity and decisiveness of someone much older than themselves combined with the insatiable curiosity of a very young child. This type may best be described as “45 going on 3.” Their unique way of perceiving the world renders them ageless in many ways – they may be totally inept at ‘adulting’ but intellectually gifted from a young age.",
    "animalTitle": "INTP – The Green Anole Lizard",
    "animalDescription": "Clever, adaptable, and curious, these beautiful lizards capture some of the brain-power and critical thinking skills common of INTPs! They have shown an ability to count, problem-solve, and modify their learning depending on their environment. Some herpetologists believe that anoles are so intelligent and quick to learn because they’ve lived in complex environments where insects are difficult to capture.  Like INTPs, they adapt to their environment and find innovative, creative ways to stay at the top of their game.",
    "officeTitle": "INTP: Dwight Schrute",
    "officeDescription": "Although INTP personalities are creative, they're also obsessed with logic — something that sounds a lot like Dwight, who loves being right. As an INTP, it's no surprise that he's always trying to start new businesses to make money (Dwight Schrute's Gym For Muscles, anyone?). At work, Dwight is always striving to be the best salesman, and if it were up to him, there wouldn't be any of the office birthday parties that Michael loves so much, which is typical INTP behavior.",
    "pizzaTitle": "Hawaiian Pizza",
    "pizzaDescription": "INTPs are unconventional and rarely preoccupied with what other people think. Just like Hawaiian pizza, you’re both parts salty and sweet, a little “out there,” and ultimately a tried and true classic that somehow just… works. While most people would never dream of combining pizza, pineapple, and ham, you’re an innovator who’s bold enough to take a calculated risk.",
    "coffeeTitle": "Iced Coffee",
    "coffeeDescription": "Coffee’s casual cousin. You see life as it is with all its positives and negatives. But being a realist can only get you so far. You tend to rest on your laurels, handling stress well and taking comfort in the work and friendships you possess, instead of taking that one step further.",
    "travelTitle": "London, England",
    "travelDescription": "INTPs are drawn to destinations where they can explore new cultures, ideas, and ways of life. They might even pursue long-term jet-setting lifestyles. Their thinking and intuitive side enjoy the digital nomad life, which makes London a stimulating city for them.\n\nIt offers fresh attractions, museum exhibitions, and events all year round, as well as historic monuments and serene gardens when INTPs need to recharge their introvert batteries. With novelty stores, tea shops, and pubs, the INTP will also get a chance to meet new people when they’re feeling sociable."

They are highly attuned to their emotional environment and attentive to both the feelings of others and the perception others have of them. ESFJs like a sense of harmony and cooperation around them, and are eager to please and provide.\n\nESFJs value loyalty and tradition, and usually make their family and friends their top priority. They are generous with their time, effort, and emotions. They often take on the concerns of others as if they were their own, and will attempt to put their significant organizational talents to use to bring order to other people's lives.",
    "mentalAgeTitle": "ESFJ - 30",
    "mentalAgeDescription": "You’re bubbly, energetic and lively but also mature, responsible and organized – embodying all the qualities of someone who has grown confidently into young adulthood. They say our early thirties are our prime years – when we are old enough to have established ourselves, yet young enough to enjoy good health. And if you’re anything, it’s confident and established. You’ve always possessed the focus and maturity of a true adult, with the warmth and energy of someone much younger.",
    "animalTitle": "ESFJ – The Vampire Bat",
    "animalDescription": "Nurturing, practical, and surprisingly smart – the vampire bat might seem like an odd choice, but it actually makes sense. These often underestimated creatures have a giant neocortex which allows them to have complex social bonds. They maintain long-term relationships with other bands and will bond for years, taking care of each other’s young, grooming, and sharing food. Like ESFJs, vampire bats believe in taking care of each other and realize that safety and security is found when you have a solid support group.",
    "officeTitle": "ESFJ: Phyllis Vance",
    "officeDescription": "As an ESFJ, Phyllis is surprisingly social and warm (even though she does tend to get a bit sassy from time to time, when the situation calls for it — and even when it doesn't). She also enjoys organizing parties, which is a very ESFJ thing to do... and when Angela tries to take full control, it's also very ESFJ for her to call her out. Or, you know, tell the entire office that she's cheating on Andy.",
    "pizzaTitle": "Pepperoni Pizza",
    "pizzaDescription": "If pizza had a homecoming king, it’d definitely be pepperoni. In high school, ESFJs were the cheerleaders and quarterbacks of the group. Fiercely dedicated, social butterflies, and wildly popular. Let’s not mince words here — there’s a reason why everyone thinks you’re so great. You’re the full package, just like pepperoni pizza, a go-to when wanting to add some kick to jazz up a slice. When we’re in a pinch for a quick bite, a hot slice of pepperoni pizza will always come through to save the day and we know you will too, ESFJ.",
    "coffeeTitle": "Frappe",
    "coffeeDescription": "Ah, the gateway drug: coffee disguised as dessert. You are coming into your own. You are friendly, outgoing and every club wants you on their roster. You can just as easily be found at home with your sister watching “Mean Girls” with face masks on a Friday night as you can be all dolled up at a house party.",
    "travelTitle": "Bangkok, Thailand",
    "travelDescription": "ESFJs are the life of the party. Their outgoing nature and infectious vibe make them fun travel companions. These walking balls of energy will enjoy the bustle of Bangkok, with its street food, tourist-favourite packed-to-the-gills Chatuchak weekend market, and the famous floating market.\n\nBut there’s more to Bangkok then just shopping and eating. The city is home to many magnificent temples, colourful nightlife, and even an elephant sanctuary that will keep the ESFJ engaged."

ESFP indicates a person who is energized by time spent with others (Extraverted), who focuses on facts and details rather than ideas and concepts (Sensing), who makes decisions based on feelings and values (Feeling) and who prefers to be spontaneous and flexible rather than planned and organized (Perceiving).

    "weaknesses": "Avoid conflict\nSensitive\nEasily bored\nPoor long-term focus",
    "overview": "ESFPs are vivacious entertainers who charm and engage those around them. They are spontaneous, energetic, and fun-loving, and take pleasure in the things around them: food, clothes, nature, animals, and especially people.\n\nESFPs are typically warm and talkative and have a contagious enthusiasm for life. They like to be in the middle of the action and the center of attention. They have a playful, open sense of humor, and like to draw out other people and help them have a good time.",
    "mentalAgeTitle": "ESFP - 16",
    "mentalAgeDescription": "It’s not that you lack the maturity or depth of your true biological age – it’s just that you embody the enthusiastic spirit of someone much younger than yourself. You are ceaselessly open to life in every facet. You work hard, play hard, love hard and live hard. Regardless of how old you become, you maintain the effervescent energy of someone much younger than yourself and it’s refreshing to everyone around you.",
    "animalTitle": "ESFP – The Blue and Gold Macaw",
    "animalDescription": "Loving, playful, and bright – the blue and gold macaw is known for its big personality and so are ESFPs! Like ESFPs, these particular macaws are adaptable, adventurous, and quick learners. They love to socialize and enjoy interacting with a variety of people. Highly observant, they enjoy being surrounded by people they love and new and interesting landscapes.",
    "officeTitle": "ESFP: Andy Bernard",
    "officeDescription": "ESFPs are known as entertainers, and has there ever been a better word to describe Andy Bernard? He's always trying to be the center of attention — especially when it comes to his musical skills — and as it turns out, that's just typical ESFP behavior. He likes to keep things fun and upbeat around the office, even if sometimes he loses his temper... or tries to drive his Prius under five miles an hour to win a duel with Dwight. ESFPs' feelings are easily hurt, and poor Andy definitely falls into that category at times.",
    "pizzaTitle": "Pesto",
    "pizzaDescription": "You love to be center stage in front of an adoring crowd. You like life to have a little extra theatrical zest. A pesto pizza is both universally beloved and slightly outside the mainstream. Order one for your audience and enjoy.",
    "coffeeTitle": "Macchiato",
    "coffeeDescription": "You are a social butterfly. You have a long contact list friends who enjoy your spontaneous and enthusiastic energy. You are a dash of milk in a lively espresso, but just because you are the life of the party doesn’t mean you don’t have a more responsible side to answer to come Monday morning.",
    "travelTitle": "Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",
    "travelDescription": "For the ESFP, a rewarding vacation is one that involves a sense of adventure. ESFPs don’t like to abide by an itinerary, and would prefer to go wherever their mood takes them. They are spontaneous and adaptable travellers who appreciate flexibility.\n\nRio de Janeiro has all the life and chaos that an ESFP can handle and appreciate. Not only does it boast scenic beaches, it also offers the vibrancy of a South American metropolis. The intrepid and street-smart ESFP not only has the chops to take on the treks and tours of the Amazon basin, but also navigate the Brazilian streets."

They are steady and committed workers with a deep sense of responsibility to others. They focus on fulfilling their duties, particularly when they are taking care of the needs of other people.

    "mentalAgeDescription": "You’ve always felt a little out of sorts around people your own age – like some part of you would rather be at home, baking cookies with your cat, than out at a wild rager. You were born with the mentality of a calm, collected adult and it hasn’t wavered much over the years. You know old age will be your time to shine. You’ll be the best gran or grandpa on the block.",
    "animalTitle": "ISFJ – The Penguin",
    "animalDescription": "Loyal, protective, and intelligent, penguins have a lot of qualities in common with ISFJs! These arctic birds have complex social abilities and will go to great lengths to take care of each other. They also have a remarkable memory for detail – returning to the same spot year after year and being able to find it, even if the landscape has changed or it’s surrounded by other colonies. Like ISFJs, penguins are also fiercely loyal, staying monogamous and recognizing their partners’ song, even in noisy colonies where hundreds of penguins are searching for each other. This ability to hone in on one individual is a trait that penguins share with humans!",
    "officeTitle": "ISFJ: Jim Halpert",
    "officeDescription": "At work, ISFJs are loyal, low-drama, and dedicated — and minus his pranks on Dwight, that's definitely Jim, because if he wasn't loyal why else would he have stayed at Dunder Mifflin so long (you know, besides for the receptionist). They're also known as imaginative people, which also applies to Jim... going back to those pranks, of course.",
    "pizzaTitle": "Chicago Deep Dish",
    "pizzaDescription": "Mama mia! Pizza doesn’t get more hearty and comforting than a Chicago-style deep dish. The layers of meaty tomato sauce and cheese packed into a thick-crusted pie pan make us think of the casseroles our aunties would bring over for dinner. ISFJs are the most nurturing of the personalities types, and like a Chicago deep dish, they just want to give you a giant hug from the inside and make sure you’re well-fed, sweetie.",
    "coffeeTitle": "Chai Latte",
    "coffeeDescription": "The base of black tea and milk give the chai latte an unknown complexity. And just like you, the warm spices add gentleness and compassion. You make the best of every situation. You love having friends come to you for advice. You know how to have your fun, but have no qualms playing “the mom” of your squad",
    "travelTitle": "Budapest, Hungary",
    "travelDescription": "ISFJs possess a unique combination of traits that create balanced personalities – they are highly analytical, perceptive, open to new ideas, and, despite being introverts, have strong people skills. They like to ruminate on the history and culture of a place, even after the trip has ended.\n\nBudapest is one city that complements them well, with its nice balance of historic sites that document their tumultuous past, wine cellars to taste traditional Hungarian wine, shabby-chic “ruin pubs”, and (literal) hotspots like the thermal baths."

They are flexible and spontaneous, and like to go with the flow to enjoy what life has to offer. ISFPs are quiet and unassuming, and may be hard to get to know. However, to those who know them well, the ISFP is warm and friendly, eager to share in life's many experiences.\n\nISFPs have a strong aesthetic sense and seek out beauty in their surroundings. They are attuned to sensory experience, and often have a natural talent for the arts. ISFPs especially excel at manipulating objects, and may wield creative tools like paintbrushes and sculptor's knives with great mastery.",

    "animalTitle": "ISFP – The Leopard",
    "animalDescription": "Elusive, empathetic, and striking – the leopard captures the enigmatic nature of the ISFP. Like ISFPs, these big cats enjoy their solitude but have an unusual empathy for other creatures at times. During a National Geographic program called ‘Eye of the Leopard’, a wild leopard killed a baboon in order to feed herself. However, once she noticed the infant baboon clinging to its mother, she groomed and cuddled the baby throughout the night as if it were her own cub.  Like the ISFP, the leopard is cunning, resourceful, and likes its space and alone time.",
    "officeTitle": "ISFP: Meredith Palmer",
    "officeDescription": "ISFPs like Meredith are spontaneous people who love taking risks and don't take criticism well when they don't agree with it — which is basically Meredith anytime someone reminds her she needs to wear underwear in the office. ISFP personalities are also known to be a bit too independent, and in the workplace, they don't always follow the rules... kind of like that time Meredith admitted she sleeps with someone at a paper supplier for lower overhead costs and Outback gift cards. But at least she gets the job done?",
    "pizzaTitle": "Anchovy Pizza",
    "pizzaDescription": "Is it weird? Is it risky? Is it a little controversial? If so, then ISFP is probably all over it. You’re always down to try something new, and the anchovy pizza is no exception. As an extremely sensory and tactile type, you love bold flavors and aesthetics. It may seem extreme to others, but the risk-taker in you just can’t resist going against the norm and trying this pungent pizza. You’re a true artist, and all artists know they must suffer (and experiment) for their work.",
    "coffeeTitle": "Mocha",
    "coffeeDescription": "You search for the beautiful and the practical. The refined and the bold. The chocolate and the coffee. You are warm and sensitive in nature, and like to look at the world in an optimistic light. You are disappointed easily and have to learn that not everyone’s burdens need become your own.",
    "travelTitle": "Florence, Italy",
    "travelDescription": "For the ISFP, travel is a wonderful dreamy adventure — even better if the trip involves lots of cultural and/or historical attractions. Where better to visit than a city with some of the greatest Renaissance art, including the famous works of Michelangelo and Raphael?\n\nGet delightfully lost in this art-soaked city, where impressive palaces, cathedrals, and sculptures can be found around every corner."

Orderly, rule-abiding, and conscientious, ESTJs like to get things done, and tend to go about projects in a systematic, methodical way.\n\nESTJs are the consummate organizers, and want to bring structure to their surroundings. They value predictability and prefer things to proceed in a logical order. When they see a lack of organization, the ESTJ often takes the initiative to establish processes and guidelines, so that everyone knows what's expected.",

    "mentalAgeDescription": "ESTJs combine the playful, gregarious spirit of a young college bro with the responsibility and diligence of a fully-formed adult.

    "animalTitle": "ESTJ – The Wolf",
    "animalDescription": "Dedicated, focused, and intelligent – wolves work in groups to take care of their pack. The ESTJ would probably be the alpha wolf, leading the pack and organizing the best hunting methods. Deeply loyal, wolves will actually develop very close relationships and bonds with each other. When they mate they mate for life, and may even sacrifice themselves for their family unit! This steadfast loyalty and determination is something we love about most ESTJs.",

    "officeDescription": "It's no surprise that if you're an ESTJ, you're a lot like Holly, because she's totally typical of this personality type. She fights for what's right, even if that just extends to the HR department, and loves rules and order, which is why she was so upset when the company let that incident with Meredith and the Outback cards slide. ESTJs also don't like to waste time with relationships that aren't going anywhere, so it makes sense that she was quick to dump AJ when he wouldn't propose to her. And now, she gets to live happily ever after with Michael, which is all any of us really wanted.",

You’re decisive and to the point, but far from boring.

Taking the guesswork out of a situation is an ESTJ’s favorite pastime.",
    "coffeeTitle": "Latte",
    "coffeeDescription": "You’re dependable. And you like your coffee to be dependable, too: a simple blend of espresso and steamed milk. You are efficient and realistic, realizing that not all the world’s problems can be solved, but that your problems can be. You strive for attainability.",
    "travelTitle": "Seoul, Korea",
    "travelDescription": "The land of kimchi and K-dramas has much to keep the dynamic ESTJ occupied. Though not as spontaneous as, say, an ESFP, ESTJs still like to have some flexibility when they travel and gravitate towards social interaction. The fast-paced lifestyle of vibrant Seoul fits them like a glove.\n\nFrom hotspots such as Hongdae and Garosu-gil, which are packed with clubs, cafes, malls and boutiques, to cultural sites such as temples and palaces, the ESTJ will love the blend of traditional and modern aspects of Seoul. Last but not least, the food streets of Myeongdong (spicy rice cakes and seafood pancakes, anyone?) will satisfy any ESTJ’s palate."

From the Waterbom water park to a jungle safari, Aling-Aling natural waterfall slide to a monkey forest, Bali has enough spills and thrills to keep the ESTP’s heart racing."

    "strengths": "Perseverance\nPlanning\nDetail orientation\nLoyalty",
    "weaknesses": "Stubbornness\nTactlessness\nGuilt\nResistance to change",
    "overview": "ISTJs are responsible organizers, driven to create and enforce order within systems and institutions. They are neat and orderly, inside and out, and tend to have a procedure for everything they do. Reliable and dutiful, ISTJs want to uphold tradition and follow regulations.\n\nISTJs are steady, productive contributors. Although they are Introverted, ISTJs are rarely isolated; typical ISTJs know just where they belong in life, and want to understand how they can participate in established organizations and systems. They concern themselves with maintaining the social order and making sure that standards are met.",
    "mentalAgeTitle": "ISTJ - 50",
    "mentalAgeDescription": "ISTJs are born responsible. This type takes their commitments direly seriously and possesses almost no trace of youthful mischievousness. They often feel older than their peers, even as children, and long to reach an age at which they will finally be taken seriously by their peers. Middle age suits the ISTJ well – they are still physically capable of getting things done, while finally being old enough to receive the respect they deserve.",
    "animalTitle": "ISTJ – The Great Horned Owl",
    "animalDescription": "Observant, protective, and revered as wise, the great horned owl captures many of the things we love about ISTJs. These mysterious-looking birds are solitary in nature, preferring to stay with their mates or families. They also are extremely focused and attentive – gliding slowly above the ground to catch unsuspecting prey. Like ISTJs these birds like to keep to themselves, but they are also very dedicated to their loved ones and very hard-working in providing for them.",
    "officeTitle": "ISTJ: Oscar Martinez",
    "officeDescription": "ISTJs take their jobs seriously and like to do well at work — just like Oscar in the accounting department. Logic and reason are important to people with this personality type, just like they are with Oscar... who's known around the office for correcting people with an \"actually\" statement that no one ever asked for. Oscar loves to be right, and if you're an ISTJ, that probably applies to you too.",
    "pizzaTitle": "Neapolitan Pizza",
    "pizzaDescription": "True pizza purists know there is nothing better than a simple marinara, fresh sliced mozzarella, and hand-torn basil to make for a perfect wood-fired pizza. It’s the way they’ve been doing it since the invention of pizza itself, and an ISTJ knows that practice makes perfect. In matters of pizza, and in matters of life, integrity is essential. You know you can depend on this pizza to taste great every time, just like we can depend on you, ISTJ.",
    "coffeeTitle": "Americano",
    "coffeeDescription": "With an uncomplicated duo of espresso and hot water, you like everything straight to the point. You are responsible and trustworthy. You work hard and you give your all to anything and everything you do. In fact, the only one who can keep up with you is an Americano. Just don’t forget to loosen the tie every now and then.",
    "travelTitle": "Kyoto, Japan",
    "travelDescription": "ISTJs rely heavily on their senses and judgement, which means they tend to find the most measured approach in any situation. They like to travel slow and steady, armed with well-planned itineraries that satisfy their cultural curiosity, so they are usually drawn to historical sites, museums, and galleries.\n\nKyoto is the ISTJ’s best bet. Its tranquil temples, a rich blend of history and architectural beauty, have attracted travellers for centuries, along with its novelty craft shops that line the streets. Navigating the city is also easy and convenient thanks to the extensive network of trains and subways, which the order-loving ISTJ would appreciate.\nBali, aside from its sun, sea, and sand, offers a range of outdoor activities that will appeal to the ESTP. From the Waterbom water park to a jungle safari, Aling-Aling natural waterfall slide to a monkey forest, Bali has enough spills and thrills to keep the ESTP’s heart racing."

    "description": "ISTP is an acronym used to describe one of the sixteen personality types created by Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers. It stands for Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving. ISTP indicates a person who is energized by time spent alone (Introverted), who focuses on facts and details rather than ideas and concepts (Sensing), who makes decisions based on logic and reason (Thinking) and who prefers to be spontaneous and flexible rather than planned and organized (Perceiving). ISTPs are sometimes referred to as Craftsperson personalities because they typically have an innate mechanical ability and facility with tools.",

    "mentalAgeTitle": "ISTP - 22",
    "mentalAgeDescription": "ISTPs are in their prime when they are at their physical peak – usually in their early twenties. This type has a devilishly rebellious spirit that relishes in sensory delights. And yet they do possess the capability and responsibility of a quasi-adult at any age. 22 truly does seem to suit this type, as an age at which they are able to live life on their own terms but are not yet bothered by the societal expectations of adulthood.",
    "animalTitle": "ISTP – The Crow",
    "animalDescription": "Resourceful, independent, intelligent – the crow exemplifies many of the strengths of the ISTP. Like ISTPs, crows are excellent problem-solvers and masters with tools. Some crows can form probes and hooks from sticks and leaf stems to poke into the crowns of palm trees. Others gather nuts from trees and place them on the street for cars to crack open. When a crow dies, the other crows will gather around the crow to find out what killed the member. Then, they will band together and chase predators down in a behavior called “mobbing.” Their cleverness, curiosity, and craftsmanship abilities remind us of the ISTP intellect.",
    "officeTitle": "ISTP: Toby Flenderson",
    "officeDescription": "Above all else, ISTPs want to solve problems in a hands-on way, which is perfect for someone who works in HR. Like a typical ISTP personality, Toby likes to create fairness in the workplace (even if Michael often disagrees with what he's doing). He's not chatty, and he's not going to push things farther than they need to go — but unfortunately, nobody he works with really truly appreciates his management style.",
    "pizzaTitle": "Homemade Pizza",
    "pizzaDescription": "ISTPs aren’t afraid to get in there and get their hands dirty. To you, making the pizza and throwing the dough around is just as much fun as eating it. You love seeing something through from conception to execution and are endlessly curious about how the world around you works. Leave it to an ISTP to experiment with different dough recipes until they find that perfect hack for an extra crispy crust. We like to think there’s no problem pizza can’t solve, and an ISTP is definitely Mr. (or Mrs.) Fix-It.",
    "coffeeTitle": "Black Coffee",
    "coffeeDescription": "You are quick-minded and fast to respond. And you need a coffee that is equally responsive. A one-ingredient-wonder, if you will. You are incredibly methodical and, as a problem solver, your mind is constantly seeking answers. However, you are also easily overwhelmed and need to learn to step out of your sensibilities every once in awhile.",
    "travelTitle": "Iceland",
    "travelDescription": "When travelling, ISTPs like to explore with their senses. They are curious but rational, which makes them highly adaptable to new environments. They are also independent and inclined to forge their own paths, so places off the beaten track appeal to them, especially places close to nature that they can explore on foot.\n\nIceland’s gorgeous scenery and gamut of outdoor activities make it the ideal place for the ISTP to connect with nature and unwind."
